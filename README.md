# txstate

An effort to statically type xstate ([more here](https://twitter.com/devanshj__/status/1297939517853196288)), ~in kinda r&d stage right now. Everything is gonna change here all the time.~ enough of that time to get to work :P

UPDATE: See the list of all features [here](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate/discussions/2323#discussioncomment-899642).

UPDATE 2: The work has been stalled long ago but you can try it using the `txstate` package (doesn't have any runtime code, just for trying out the types).
